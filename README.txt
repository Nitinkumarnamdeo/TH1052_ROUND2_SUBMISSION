Prototype:An innovation of Plug & Play Architecture, Nano & Biotechnology driven Ai & IOT based bioreactors & bioeconomy solutions for the sustainable waste water and Energy.

Problem Statement: 80% of water used per capita generates wastewater, As per CPCB, sewage generation vs treatment capacity, there is a gap of ~ 72% 
and due to discharge of untreated waste into rivers, ponds and land. it has several harmful impacts e.g ground water contamination,
 water borne disease, soil fertility degradation, biodiversity loss, climate change, human health risk, water scarcity & pollution.

Technology & Solution:Octomen's Attached Growth Bacteria Process Trickling Filter Technology for 50KLD wastewater treatment plant required space (L X B X H = 5 ft X 5 ft X 7 ft)
1. Onsite Treatment system
2. Low space requirement (easy to fit in tight spaces)
3. Low Energy consumption (1KWH for 50KLD, 4kh of BOD/KwH vs 1.5kg of BOD/KwH)
4. Plug and Play Device(can start wastewater treatment plant within 15 days of any capacity)
5. Low Lifecycle cost (Only pumps & media required to operate), no aerators or Blowers required
6. Resilient to shock loads & FOG,
7. Simultaneous Aerobic & Anaerobic digestion - produces low sludge yield
8. Scalable & Modular approach
9. Multi Handling Area technology

Future Scope:
The prototype can be scaled with sustainable & ecofriendly material for life Long lasting performance & easy to replace with new ones.
1.Advanced Nano Material for biological activity enhancement to increase capacity in compact space,
2.AI modelling for water quality, river runoff, graound water contanimation & recharge monitoring & predictive analysis of detection of pIoT integration,
3.Mobile dashboards for real-time monitoring & UI/UX 
4.Wastewater quality and sludge management (Recyclable Energy from Biomass)
5.Cluster-based decentralized systems across mela zones,integrated with command centers for predictive alerts and rapid decision-making. 
6.Portable/mobile FSTP and ETP units for camps and ghats, sludge-to-biofertilizer and biogas recovery modules for circular economy adoption,
and treated water reuse applications for sanitation, irrigation, and cleaning. 
7. Designed for scalability, the solution can be replicated in future Kumbh Melas and other mass gatherings, making Simhastha Ujjain a global benchmark in sustainable
